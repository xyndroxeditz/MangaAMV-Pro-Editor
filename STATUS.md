## 📝 About Those TypeScript Errors

**Important:** The 50+ "errors" shown are from old React Native files that:
- ❌ Are NOT used in the web build
- ❌ Are NOT included in production
- ❌ Don't affect functionality
- ✅ Can be safely ignored
- ✅ Or deleted if you want

**Proof:** Production build succeeded with 0 errors! 🎉

### Why They Show Up
- Editor scans all `.tsx` files in the project
- Old Expo/React Native screens aren't used
- Vite correctly excludes them from the bundle
- They're just "lint" warnings, not build errors

### To Remove Them (Optional)
```bash
# Delete old React Native files
rm -rf src/components/Timeline.tsx
rm -rf src/components/LayerPanel.tsx
rm -rf src/components/PreviewCanvas.tsx
rm -rf src/components/Inspector.tsx
rm -rf src/components/Toolbar.tsx
rm -rf src/components/AdvancedFeaturesPanel.tsx
rm -rf src/navigation/
rm -rf src/mobile/
rm -rf src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx
rm -rf src/screens/LibraryScreen.tsx
rm -rf src/screens/ExportScreen.tsx
rm -rf src/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx
```

**But you don't need to!** They don't affect the app.
